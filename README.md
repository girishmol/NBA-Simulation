The NBA Career Simulator is an interactive Python program that lets the user experience the career of an NBA player beginning on draft night. After entering their name, the user is selected as the first overall pick and randomly assigned to one of eight teams, each with a preset power rating that influences outcomes. The simulation skips the regular season and places the user directly into the playoffs, where they compete in the first round, second round, and NBA Finals, with each best-of-seven series determined by team power levels, randomization, and user decisions such as resting or training after losses. Throughout the experience, the program tracks seasons played, championships won, and playoff performance. The user’s career can end by personal choice, by winning a championship and choosing not to continue, or automatically after 20 seasons. Winning a title increases the player’s ring count, while losing results in the simulation advancing to the next season.
